In this project we are going to predict the price of flight tickets from Vistara airline. We carried out a comprehensive exploratory data analysis using various high-level plots from seaborn, like histplot, scatterplot and regplot. The project illustrates the use of feature scaling using scikit-learn highlighting the differences between nominal and ordinal categorical features. It also uses Optuna for fine-tuning the parameters of a xgboost regressor created to estimate ticket price
